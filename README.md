# AI Chatbot
This is an AI chatbot named JUHIPUHI built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The chatbot interacts with users in real-time and fetches responses using the Google Gemini API. Unlike advanced AI models like ChatGPT and Gemini, this chatbot does not have the capability to store or update memory across conversations.

## Features
1. Real-Time Interaction: The chatbot provides instant responses to user queries.
2. Google Gemini API Integration: Utilizes Google Gemini API to generate responses.
3. Simple UI: A clean and user-friendly interface built with HTML and CSS.
4. No Memory Storage: Each user interaction is independent, with no context or memory carried over between interactions.

## Technologies Used
1. HTML: For structuring the chatbot interface.
2. CSS: For styling the interface and ensuring a responsive design.
3. JavaScript: For handling user input, making API calls, and updating the chatbot UI dynamically.
4. Google Gemini API: For generating AI-based responses to user queries.

## Usage
Type your message into the input box and press Enter or click the send button to interact with the chatbot. The chatbot will fetch and display a response generated by the Google Gemini API. Note that each interaction is independent, with no memory or context retained between them.

1. Sign up for access to the Google Gemini API.
2. Obtain your API key from the Google Developer Console.
